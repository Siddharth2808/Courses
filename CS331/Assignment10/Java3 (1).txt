In this weeks assignment you need to simulate the railroad network as discussed in class. The details are as given below.


There are two stations A and B. The trains ( 5 of them ) ply between them back and forth. There are 3 stations in between A and B. The track layout at the station facilitates switching of trains between the parallel tracks. You may place signals at appropriate points along the track to coordinate the movement of trains.

The signal posts and trains are concurrent threads with act pretty much independently of each other and coordinate via the signal lights.  Simulate this concurrent environment. You are required to generate timestamped traces for all the actions done by all concurrent agents. There is no global time but you may assume that the local clock may be off by at most, say T, minutes.

Prove some desirable properties that your program possess (Like deadlock avoidance, freeness etc) in addition to mutual exclusion. (Lack of mutual exclusion essentially means that the trains reach too close for comfort!)
