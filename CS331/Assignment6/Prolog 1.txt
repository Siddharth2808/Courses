1. Write a two prolog program to sort a list of numbers. The first program must use the permutation based logic discuss in class.
Try running this program and convince yourself that the program doesn't work well for even moderately sized inputs
The second program must be a computationally tractable. 

2. Given an undirected graph G, two vertices s and t, and a positive integer k, write a prolog program to check if t is reachable from s in exactly k steps.
The program must list at least one such path if such a path  exist.
