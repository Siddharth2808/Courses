Assignments for this week.

1. Read and understand chapter 10 of the text book.
2. Watch the video on I/O

3. Implement the following two player game in Haskell


 The state of the game is defined by a finite list of integers. During each move, the state of the game is altered.  Assume that the list is [l1,l2,...,lk]. The following alterations are valid moves.

a) Reduction: In this move you may choose an integer from  list and reduce it by a positive amount

Ex.  [1,2,3,4,5]  can be "Reduced" to [1,2,1,4,5]

b) Split: In this move, you may choose an integer from the list and "split it" resulting in a longer list. The parts of the splits must both be positive and non zero.

Ex [1,2,3,40,5] can be split to [1,2,3,13,37]


You are not required to play the optimum strategy. (Of course, it will be nice if you can)

The program must provide three modes of play.

1. Human versus Human
2. Human versus Computer
3. Computer Versus Computer

For this week you are required to implement just Human versus Human.
