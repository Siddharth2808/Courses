1. The task for this week is to write programs that can simulate Dining Philosophers problem.
Specifically, you have to describe precisely some correctness guarantees in distributed computing context. ( It may be deadlock avoidance or starvation freeness o fairness or any other guarantee that you may come up with.) You need to prove that your program achieves the claimed guarantees.


Your programs must use the synchronisation primitives discussed in class.
