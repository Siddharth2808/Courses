Advantages: 
1) This lift system is truly sequential, after each iteration we can have new interuptions. Means , new people can arrive at any time.
2) Apart from that this is very close to real world lift system, where people will be lifted if they also want to go in same direction, where lift is going
Even if they pushed button late. This saves a lot of time.
3) Also, in case of double lift system, one lift is going upward and second is going downwards, which saves a lot of time, as people going in any direction will have equal priority.
4) This lift system doesn't let any person starve.
Hence, in these ways it is very faor to users.
